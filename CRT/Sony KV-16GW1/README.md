### Notes:
This is not optimized for 3D printing **yet**, it is a 1:1 recreation of the original part. If you intend to use this part for your own project, I highly advise making modifications to improve the performance and strength when 3D printed. 
*This message will be removed when I update the model.*

Feel free to modify for use in projects, this is great for RGB and S-Video mods.
When I come to do my own RGB/S-Video mod, I will upload respective versions of the CAD with modifications

Please let me know if you encounter any issues with the model!
